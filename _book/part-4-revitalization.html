<h2>Highlights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#highlights-11"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Major takeaways in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using both federal and state dollars, a suite of community revitalization and capacity building programs foster creative approaches to meet the unique housing needs of Virginia’s diverse communities.</li>
<li>Capacity building programs, especially those offered by Virginia Housing, strengthen affordable housing providers and make them resilient to future challenges.</li>
<li>Opportunities for improvement are primarily administrative: these include better alignment of applications and project timelines, technical assistance, ease of entry, and streamlining the closing process.</li>
<li>Expanding the successful Vibrant Community Initiative, aligning state revitalization efforts with local public housing revitalization goals, encouraging more inclusive land use strategies, and greater involvement of BIPOC developers and contractors are all ways to enhance these programs.</li>

<p>Federal CDBG dollars are restricted to 80 percent AMI and below, so all funds benefit households with low incomes. However, DHCD’s CDBG funds are used primarily to serve VLI households (those below 50 percent AMI) and ELI households (those below 30 percent AMI).</p>

<p>Stakeholders expressed positive views of VCI as a model of how the state can facilitate projects that result in change at a significant scale. These projects can catalyze long term neighborhood improvement by encouraging similar successful efforts on nearby sites.</p>
<p>VCI also demonstrates the value that the state can bring to a problem by combining resources on the front end, rather than leaving it to the developers to shop for them one at a time.</p>

<h5>Virginia Housing’s Community Impact Grant (CIG) has been well received as a flexible tool that works across many different regions of the state to accomplish different objectives.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#virginia-housings-community-impact-grant-cig-has-been-well-received-as-a-flexible-tool-that-works-across-many-different-regions-of-the-state-to-accomplish-different-objectives."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Stakeholders value the CIG program particularly for its flexibility that allows for its wide application supporting a variety of projects. Stakeholders appreciate the program’s support for innovations such as manufactured housing and other construction strategies. The CIGs also have financed a broad array of creative approaches to help communities strategically address their unique affordable housing challenges.</p>

</h5>
<p>Funding for community development projects in rural areas is not widely available. The non-entitlement CDBG program is unique in the scale of grant funding that it can bring to the table. Stakeholders saw it as an excellent tool for offsetting site development and utility extensions for rural projects—which have costs that often render a project infeasible.</p>

</h5>
<p>Local governments are critical partners in the development of affordable housing for numerous reasons. They control land use, manage community expectations, provide access to utilities, and provide resources in the form of financial assistance and processing incentives. However, these communities need help in developing project concepts and understanding what type of state assistance is accessible.</p>
<p>Stakeholders were extremely complimentary of the staff time and resources dedicated by both state housing agencies to community outreach and assistance.</p>

<p>As resources for affordable housing increase, affordable housing sponsors face the fundamental challenge of bolstering their own capacity to deliver services.

</h5>
<p>Stakeholders recommend that housing agencies sustain and increase support and advisory services to localities and developers who are working to assemble large scale, complex projects requiring funding within the next year. Shepherding these projects on a path toward feasibility is a priority, especially in an environment where the resources essential to project success are only expected to rise.</p>

</h5>
<p>Some local stakeholders indicated difficulty in determining where to find information and which staff person to contact depending on the project they are planning. Other stakeholders suggested a more clearly defined entry point for technical assistance and support, especially for localities whose employees may be less familiar with state housing agency staff and organizational structure.</p>

<h5>The Predevelopment Loan Program closing process can be too complex; limited project eligibility can lock out otherwise worthy applicants.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-predevelopment-loan-program-closing-process-can-be-too-complex-limited-project-eligibility-can-lock-out-otherwise-worthy-applicants."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Several stakeholders noted that the Predevelopment Loan Program is time consuming and its approval process lacks clarity. The closing process can be too complicated for the size of the transactions. There is a natural balance between the need for flexible predevelopment support and the lender’s need for repayment; a reevaluation of this balance could lead to a retooled model that is easier to use and more successful.</p>
<p>The design of the Predevelopment Loan Program should be revisited in consultation with housing developers—especially nonprofits and small for-profits.</p>

</h5>
<p>Over the last five years, Virginia Housing has developed a capacity building initiative aimed at helping nonprofit organizations grow their ability to be successful developers and administrators of affordable housing. Its wide use by the nonprofit community underscores the need for it. The nonprofit sector’s growth in capacity may certainly be credited, at least in part, to the array of assistance the program has provided.</p>
<p>In the last several years, the capacity building initiative has added a number of new funding tiers. Some stakeholders expressed concern that the flexibility that characterized the earlier program is becoming more rigid. They emphasized the widely differing circumstances of providers and suggested a return to more of a negotiated technical support package.</p>

</h5>
<p><strong>Why this is needed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholders strongly supported this initiative primarily because these projects are high impact, and the state has innovatively assembled a variety of resources in one location, so the developer does not need to navigate multiple access points. Agencies should develop and deploy a planning grant specific to VCI to increase and improve applications. This would also help put smaller jurisdictions on a more competitive footing with larger, more experienced teams.</li>
<li>The planning grant program widely used with CDBG for many years may be an applicable prototype. HUD also deploys planning grants to localities and PHAs that are seeking funding under the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative; a similar state option would helpfully supplement those efforts in communities with public housing.</li>
<li>Virginia Housing recently made awards to planning district commissions (PDCs) in the state with the purpose of encouraging them to develop stronger relationships with affordable housing providers.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.vhda.com/about/NewsCenter/Pages/PDC-Partnership-July132021.pdf"&gt;Virginia Housing Announces $40 Million in Grant Funding for PDCs.&lt;/a&gt;” Virginia Housing.

</ul>
<p><strong>How to accomplish:</strong></p>
<p>Virginia Housing and DHCD should allocate funds to the VCI for project planning using the earlier cited models. Depending on project scale, these grants could run from 12 to 24 months with prescribed deliverables included in the VCI application. A scoring incentive for planning grant recipients could encourage organizations to use the grant to shape more realistic and feasible proposals. Virginia Housing could position its CIG program to be used more frequently to support the development of VCI applications.</p>

</h5>
<p><strong>Why this is needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholders report that rural (non-entitlement) areas have less knowledge about state housing agency programs and fewer relevant staff positions.</li>
<li>A clearer path with guidance on appropriate contacts for specific issues would foster a more level playing field for potential applicants.</li>

</h5>
<p><strong>Why this is needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some stakeholders noted that the current Predevelopment Loan Program would be more widely used if it had greater flexibility and offered a more timely, less complicated processing and closing experience. The purpose of the predevelopment assistance is to allow a more thinly capitalized developer to expend the funds needed to assemble a viable project application in a timely and efficient manner.</li>
<li>Architecture, legal, appraisal, and engineering are the types of expenses that must be paid at the front end of the development process—often before the fate of the application is determined.</li>
<li>The challenge with any predevelopment loan program is balancing loan risk with the need to fund activities before feasibility is established.</li>

<p><strong>Who is responsible:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia Housing</li>
<li>Program users, especially smaller nonprofit and for-profit developers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to accomplish:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why this is needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The replacement or revitalization of large, aging public housing communities is one of the most pressing problems in the Commonwealth.

<li>HUD is supporting the transformation of public housing and shifting the funding platform to the more reliable Section 8 mechanism through the Rental Assistance Demonstration program (RAD) and through Section 18 - Demolitions/Dispositions.</li>
<li>Replacement and revitalization of public housing is quantifiable and achievable. The oldest and worst public housing in the state are the large projects built in the 1970s and earlier. Many of them have already been revitalized and replaced, but a significant number remain—just under 10,000 units scattered across Virginia’s large metro areas.

<p>Public housing revitalization is a complex and expensive undertaking. The revitalization programs that make up this cluster are well positioned to aid this process. Virginia Housing has already prioritized this work through the PHA pool in the LIHTC program as well as a set-aside of REACH funding for these types of projects.</p>
