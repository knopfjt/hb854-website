<p>Major takeaways in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electricity, gas, water, and other essential utility costs strain the budgets of low-income Virginians—as well as those of affordable housing providers working to build and preserve units across the state.</li>
<li>COVID-19 demonstrated that reliable high-speed internet access is critical for work, education, and healthcare for families. However, more than one-in-three households earning less than $20,000 do not have internet access in Virginia.</li>
<li>State law and regulatory precedent disallow specific rate reduction carve outs for affordable housing.</li>
<li>Instead, Virginia can address these challenges by unifying current and new efforts supported by expanded state and federal funding, helping localities reduce up-front utility costs for affordable housing, bolstering current energy efficiency measures, and leveraging the Commonwealth’s substantial new broadband investments to increase internet access and affordability for residents in affordable housing.</li>

<p>HB854 requests the SAG to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“. . . consider the following proposals as well as other proposals it considers advisable during the course of its analysis and deliberations: . . . <strong>utility rate reduction for qualified affordable housing</strong>. . .”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Utilities are an important but often overlooked aspect of affordable housing. They contribute to upfront development costs and then affect affordability through regular service bills for residents and property owners. While mortgage or rent is the main source of a housing cost burden, sometimes households must also dedicate a large share of their income on basic services like electricity and gas.</p>
<p>Different formulas calculate this financial hardship and measure affordability.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Marilyn A Brown et al., &lt;span&gt;“Low-Income Energy Affordability: Conclusions from a Literature Review”&lt;/span&gt; (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, March 2020), &lt;a href="https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub124723.pdf" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub124723.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>55</sup></a></span> For the purposes of this report, “energy cost burden” refers to the share of a household’s income spent specifically on home energy bills. When this burden is too large, it contributes to greater housing insecurity, primarily for low-income households with less spending power.</p>
<p>The subgroup concentrated on household energy burden, which includes the group’s suggested solutions to reduce costs associated with the development and preservation of energy efficient affordable housing. The subgroup also addressed access to and affordability of high-quality internet service to residents of affordable housing, as internet has proven to be an essential household utility.</p>

<p>The threshold for energy cost burden is six percent of household income.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Fisher Sheehan and Colton, &lt;span&gt;“Home Energy Affordability Gap,”&lt;/span&gt; 2021, &lt;a href="http://www.homeenergyaffordabilitygap.com/index.html" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;http://www.homeenergyaffordabilitygap.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>56</sup></a></span> This calculation includes all costs associated with energy used by the home (e.g., electricity and natural gas), but excludes other utilities like trash collection and internet.</p>
<p>Households paying more than six percent of their income for their home energy bills are at much greater risk of being unable to meet all other necessary expenses. According to tabulations of the Consumer Expenditure Survey by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Severely cost-burdened renter households in the bottom expenditure quartile (a proxy for lowest income) spent 38 percent less on food and 40 percent less on healthcare in 2018 than otherwise similar renters with housing they could afford.”</em><span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Joint Center for Housing Studies, &lt;span&gt;“America’s Rental Housing 2020,”&lt;/span&gt; 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/americas-rental-housing-2020" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/americas-rental-housing-2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>57</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Energy cost burden disproportionately impacts low-income households as, on average, they spend ten percent or more of their income on utilities compared to the five percent or less spent by middle- and upper-income households. In 2020, Virginians below 50 percent of the Federal Poverty Level spent 31 percent of their income on home energy bills alone.</p>

<p>High cost burdens can reduce a household’s ability to use electricity, heat or cool their home, or even have running water. Some households choose between paying utility bills and paying mortgage or rent, or other essential expenses. This in turn contributes to high levels of housing instability, including evictions and foreclosures.</p>

<p>On average, the nominal retail price of residential electricity in Virginia has increased annually by roughly 0.18 cents per kilowatt-hour from 1990 to 2019. When adjusting the price using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of electricity for urban consumers in U.S. cities, the real price of electricity has decreased by 0.30 percent on average per year during the same period.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that high-speed internet is a vital tool in everyday life. As a result, disparities in broadband access exacerbate existing inequity throughout Virginia.</p>
<p>The statewide provider survey, focus groups, and discussion within this subgroup all identified equitable access to broadband as a need for low-income households and residents in affordable housing.</p>
<p>Across the Commonwealth, more than one-in-three households earning less than $20,000 do not have internet access, compared to fewer than one-in-twenty households earning $75,000 or more.</p>

<p>Since 2017, the Commonwealth has awarded $140 million and connected 124,000 locations to address broadband accessibility throughout Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Broadband investments funded by the CARES Act</strong></p>
<p>In October 2020, Virginia dedicated $30 million of federal CARES Act dollars to projects that will expand broadband access and affordability across the state. As of spring 2021, the state has funded 71 projects throughout 50 localities. Some relevant examples include:</p>

</ul>
<p>Along with these affordability-focused projects in urban areas, CARES Act funding supported 45 “last mile” projects to expand broadband access in predominantly rural areas. These investments to deploy physical infrastructure are the state’s priority in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Other recent state actions</strong></p>
<p>Broadband expansion was a key topic during the 2021 General Assembly session. Virginia developed two new pilot programs and passed legislation to expand broadband access and close disparity gaps.</p>
<p>The first program authorizes the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) to design a program to expand reliable internet access for low-income residents by providing them with up to $15 in reimbursement costs monthly. VDSS was required to report its recommendations by November 1, 2021.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2021/2/HB1800/Chapter/1/359/"&gt;Appropriation Act - Item 359 L&lt;/a&gt;, 2021 Special Session I, Virginia General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The second program requires DHCD to create a program within the Virginia Telecommunication Initiative (VATI) where public broadband authorities are permitted to apply for program funds without private sector investment.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1923"&gt;HB1923&lt;/a&gt; Broadband capacity; expands existing pilot program, municipal broadband authorities. 2021 Special Session I, Virginia General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Lawmakers also adopted a third bill which authorizes school boards to appropriate funds for the expansion and operation of broadband for educational purposes.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SB1225"&gt;SB1225&lt;/a&gt; Broadband services; school boards to appropriate funds for expansion of services for education. 2021 Special Session I, Virginia General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>67</sup></a> School boards may partner with private broadband service providers and subsidize broadband for qualifying households.</p>
<p>Additionally, Governor Northam and the General Assembly have appropriated $700 million in American Rescue Plan funding to expand universal broadband coverage. This investment accelerated the Governor’s 10-year goal for achieving universal internet access from 2028 to 2024.</p>
<div class="info">
<p><strong>What are other states doing?</strong> Over the past year, nearly every state in the nation has taken up or is considering new legislation to expand broadband or make it more affordable. These bills, including a handful specifically related to affordable housing, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/broadband-2021-legislation.aspx">are listed</a> on the National Conference of State Legislatures website.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Internet and LIHTC</strong></p>
<p>As of today, none of the methods to calculate utility allowances for LIHTC developments include broadband internet as a utility for residents. Internet costs are categorized alongside telephone, cable, and other non-essential utilities; without any changes, <em>simply adding internet to LIHTC utility allowances would lower total rent collected and add additional up-front costs.</em></p>
<p>However, many states do encourage internet infrastructure for new LIHTC units. For example, Virginia Housing currently awards points in its 2019-2020 Qualified Allocation Plan for internet as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>One point awarded</em> “if each unit is provided with the necessary infrastructure for high-speed Internet/broadband service.”</li>
<li>
<em>Four points awarded</em> “if free Wi-Fi access is provided in the community room and such access is restricted to resident only usage.”</li>
<li>
<em>Six points awarded</em> “if each unit is provided with free individual high-speed Internet access.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If developers receive additional support to offset initial costs, they likely will pursue these points more frequently as internet continues to rise in importance and becomes a significant market advantage.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 assistance</strong></p>
<p>Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, providers of electric, gas, water, and sewer utilities were subject to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shut-off moratorium preventing termination of service due to unpaid bills<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This moratorium began on March 16, 2020 and expired on October 5, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>69</sup></a>,</li>
<li>Establishment of emergency debt repayment plans for customers more than 30 days behind on their bills, and</li>
<li>Debt forgiveness for customers using CARES Act funding from the federal government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Utilities have also been encouraging customers to take advantage of LIHEAP funds and provider programs such as Dominion Energy’s EnergyShare.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (VDSS)</strong></p>
<p>The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federally-funded resource that covers “costs associated with home energy bills, energy crises, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs.”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap"&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>VDSS administers LIHEAP in Virginia. Households are eligible for LIHEAP funds if they earn less than 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or 60 percent of Virginia median income if using funds for weatherization.</p>
<p>Virginia received more than $87.8 million in LIHEAP funds in fiscal year 2021 and $23.3 million in supplemental funds from the CARES Act. Across Virginia in fiscal year 2019, LIHEAP provided heating assistance to 102,858 households, cooling assistance to 65,196 households, and crisis assistance to 16,592 households.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://liheappm.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/congress/profiles/2019/FY%202019%20VA%20Profile.pdf"&gt;Virginia LIHEAP FY2019 State Profile&lt;/a&gt; (PDF)&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Weatherization Assistance Program (DHCD)</strong></p>
<p>The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) helps provide energy efficiency upgrades to low-income households. Funds are provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and are used to install insulation, repair heating and cooling systems, and other energy-saving uses.</p>
<p>Prior to 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, WAP funded nearly $5 million in weatherization activities across the state, reaching more than 1,200 households annually.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of Income Payment Program (VDSS and DHCD)</strong></p>
<p>In 2021 the General Assembly passed legislation to begin the Percentage of Income Payment Program (PIPP).<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0308"&gt;HB230&lt;/a&gt; Percentage of Income Payment Program and Fund; DHCD &amp;amp; DSS to adopt rules, etc., for adoption. 2021 Special Session I, Virginia General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>72</sup></a> PIPP limits the total electric bills for eligible low-income customers of Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power and directs customers to other resources to alleviate their energy cost burden. VDSS, with help from DHCD, will begin drafting program regulations this year.</p>
<p>In the bill, lawmakers also asked the state to conduct a gap analysis and determine what service gaps, if any, continue to exist for PIPP-eligible customers.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Va.

<p><strong>Utility sponsored and administered programs</strong></p>
<p>Private utilities in Virginia offer charitable programs to provide utility assistance to customers in need. Private donations, usually from ratepayer voluntary contributions, typically fund these unregulated programs. One well-known example is the Dominion Energy EnergyShare program, which provides bill payment assistance and weatherization services.</p>
<p>Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power have also just recently expanded their energy efficiency program offerings pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-585.1/">56-585.1</a>, referred to as “Phase VIII” initiatives in their demand side management (DSM) program.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and Housing Innovations in Energy Efficiency (DHCD)</strong></p>
<p>The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a cap-and-trade program designed to reduce climate pollution from fossil fuel power plants. Virginia joined RGGI in 2020, bringing the total number of participant states to eleven across the eastern seaboard. By capping emissions, RGGI requires energy producers to either reduce pollution or buy allowances at auction. Funds raised at RGGI auctions flow to the states. According to DHCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Legislation passed by the Virginia General Assembly authorizes proceeds from these auctions to be used for community flood preparedness, coastal resilience and energy efficiency programs for affordable housing. DHCD will administer approximately 50 percent of the auction proceeds through [the Housing Innovations in Energy Efficiency (HIEE) program], with technical assistance from the Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy (DMME).”</em><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;DHCD &lt;a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/hiee"&gt;Housing Innovations in Energy Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>76</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Housing Innovations in Energy Efficiency (HIEE) program expands energy efficiency measures in residential buildings to benefit low-income Virginians. DHCD formed a HIEE Stakeholder Advisory Group in 2020 to establish priorities and craft guidelines for the program.</p>
<p>Virginia’s first RGGI auction in March 2021 produced $21.7 million in proceeds to the Commonwealth. For fiscal year 2021 these funds have been distributed through DHCD’s Affordable and Special Needs Housing (ASNH) program and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).</p>
<div class="info">
<p>On July 8, 2021, Governor Northam <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/july/headline-898621-en.html">announced</a> more than $21 million in 24 new ASNH loans for affordable housing projects across Virginia. This includes $6.2 million in HIEE funds to support energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades.</p>
</div>
<p>Beginning in January 2022, lawmakers will receive an annual report on RGGI participation and fund distribution jointly prepared by DHCD, the Department of Conservation and Recreation DCR, and Department of Energy.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Va.

<p><strong>Utility hookup fees</strong></p>
<p>Initial fees for water, wastewater, and other basic infrastructure can be a significant hard cost for affordable housing developers. These expenses are rolled into the project’s financing, increasing the level of debt service needed, and adding to the eventual rent or sales price amounts. Since 2010, the statewide average water and wastewater hookup costs have steadily risen.</p>

<div class="info">
<p>To date, very few localities are known to have waiver or reduction policies using the authority granted in Va. Code Ann § 15.2-958.4. The <a href="https://www.charlottesville.gov/682/Programs-for-Homeowners-Renters">City of Charlottesville</a> will reduce water and sewer connection fees by up to 75 percent for certain projects, and Arlington County is studying proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing utility costs in multifamily properties</strong></p>
<p>Utility bills for multifamily apartment buildings can be paid several different ways. In some cases, each unit has individual meters and tenants pay independently. Alternatively, the building may be master-metered where the owner pays the entire property bill and builds the cost into the price of rent. In many cases, multiple utilities are metered and billed differently in the same property.</p>
<p>Efforts to encourage energy efficiency and conservation in multifamily properties are often challenging. When utilities are metered individually and paid by tenants, building owners have few reasons to make energy improvements in the building. When utilities are master-metered, the pricing structure usually gives tenants little incentive to conserve their energy use. This market failure is called a <em>split incentive</em>.</p>

FIGURE 27.8: Sample monthly energy costs for all-electric multifamily building
</p>
</div>
<p>When multifamily properties have income and rent restrictions as part of affordable rental housing programs, such as LIHTC, utility payment becomes more complex. In buildings where some or all utilities are paid by tenants, property managers must reduce the net rent to account for these payments to keep the overall housing costs for residents affordable. Specifics vary with each program, but this calculated reduction is generally referred to as the <em>utility allowance</em>.</p>
<p>The complicated methods for estimating utility allowances in affordable rental properties are beyond the scope of this report, but policymakers must understand that utility allowances can help overcome split incentives by giving owners a pathway to cover the costs of and gain savings from efficiency improvements. Virginia’s affordable rental housing stock represents an important opportunity to deploy energy efficiency investments.</p>

<p>In early 2021 the HB854 utility rate reduction subgroup met four times to discuss how Virginia can expand its efforts to reduce utility costs and energy cost burdens for affordable housing developers and residents. Based on discussions with experts from across the Commonwealth and input from members of the subgroup, the subgroup makes the following recommendations.</p>

</h5>
<p>Virginia should strategically organize, prioritize, and deploy new federal and state funds available for residential energy efficiency and utility assistance. Since HB854 was first drafted in early 2020, a number of important developments have occurred that dramatically changed the landscape of utilities and housing:</p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 pandemic has had long-term impacts including an economic downturn,</li>
<li>The CARES Act, American Rescue Plan, and other major federal relief packages include significant rounds of funding for utility assistance, weatherization, and energy efficiency,</li>
<li>RGGI participation will generate funds for DHCD to use for increased energy efficiency measures in affordable housing, and</li>
<li>PIPP will reduce energy cost burdens for low-income customers of Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes require state policymakers and program administrators to holistically evaluate where and how to use these new resources while meeting needs without wasteful duplication of services.</p>

<div id="strategy-1.1" class="section level4 unlisted unnumbered">
<h4>Strategy 1.1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#strategy-1.1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p><em>Direct increased resources to expand current programs into markets and demographics that are currently underserved by utility and efficiency efforts. These include single-family rentals, non-subsidized multifamily, and manufactured homes.</em></p>
<p>According to analysis by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the three major underserved markets for energy assistance are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Multifamily and other rental housing</strong> due to the split incentive problem,</li>
<li>
<strong>Rural communities</strong> due to lower density, different energy sources, limited provider capacity, and higher infrastructure costs per capita, and</li>
<li>
<strong>Manufactured and mobile homes</strong> due to lower household incomes, nonstandard tenure (especially in mobile home parks), concentration in rural areas, and highly inefficient construction in older units.</li>
</ol>
<p>When evaluating needs and redesigning programs, policymakers should create specific plans to bring solutions to these underserved markets. This work will complement ongoing work by DHCD and VDSS to conduct a gap analysis as required by HB2330, which enables the PIPP program. According to that bill, this analysis may:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“. . . review the needs of PIPP-eligible customers and whether gaps remain in serving such customers that are not already served by existing and available federal, state, local, or nonprofit programs to meet the energy reduction obligations of this section.”</em></p>

<h4>Strategy 2.1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#strategy-2.1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p><em>Link funding streams between federal, state, and local resources for reducing initial utility hookup costs (and necessary upgrades to older infrastructure) in affordable housing.</em></p>
<p>Resources for affordable housing development and local infrastructure investments have expanded significantly over the past several years, primarily due to federal pandemic relief packages. State policymakers and local officials should find ways to strategically use these dollars—and other associated incentives—to help reduce upfront utility costs for affordable housing without placing undue pressure on municipal revenue streams.</p>
<div class="open">
<p><strong>Action items:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 2.1.1:</strong> Explore mechanisms for Virginia to establish incentives within housing, community development, and related programs to reward localities that provide utility discounts to affordable housing developers. Determine eligibility and prioritization criteria, potential funding sources, and any additional legislative authority needed. Incentives should establish a rational basis for assistance based on costs and needs within different regions and markets.</p>

</h4>
<p><em>Collaborate with localities and the General Assembly to expand tools available for reducing utility hook up costs rather than mandate fee waivers for affordable housing.</em></p>
<p>Statewide mandates for localities to lower or waive utility hookup costs and other fees for affordable housing risk counterproductive outcomes. Regional and market variations in infrastructure costs would be a barrier to uniform statewide fee limits or discounts, and mandatory cost reductions limit the ability of localities to provide debt service on bonds.</p>

<p>Although the state is making significant strides to bring broadband to more people, many challenges and gaps remain. There are now more resources than ever to meet Governor’s Northam goal of full broadband access by 2024, and state policymakers should take advantage of this momentum to ensure residents of affordable housing are not left behind.</p>
<p>One important distinction in this discussion is broadband access versus affordability. Solutions to expand access focus on new infrastructure in rural areas and other underserved places. Increasing affordability—especially for low-income customers—typically involves direct household subsidies or making network access free.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the urban and rural divide. In denser cities and suburbs, where broadband infrastructure may already be common, expanding access and affordability via free Wi-Fi and other connection types is highly effective. In non-metro areas without widespread wireless access, extending infrastructure and coverage of household connectivity requires more subsidy.</p>
